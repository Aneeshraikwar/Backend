# Chapter 4: Routes

Welcome back! In [Chapter 1: Mongoose Models](01_mongoose_models_.md), we designed our data structures. In [Chapter 2: Database Connection (DBconnect)](02_database_connection__dbconnect__.md), we connected our application to the database. And in [Chapter 3: Express Application Instance (app)](03_express_application_instance__app__.md), we created our central server instance (`app`) and set up initial processing steps using middleware.

So, our `app` instance is ready to receive requests. But when a request arrives, like someone trying to register a new account or log in, how does our application know *which* specific piece of code should handle that particular request?

This is where **Routes** come in!

## What are Routes?

Imagine our backend is a bustling city, and the `app` instance ([Chapter 3: Express Application Instance (app)](03_express_application_instance__app__.md)) is the main road network receiving all traffic. **Routes** are like the **addresses and signposts** within this city. They tell the incoming "traffic" (the request) exactly where to go to find the specific service or information it's looking for.

Every request that comes into our server has two main identifiers:

1.  **The URL Path:** This is the part of the address after the domain name (e.g., `/api/v1/users/register`, `/videos/123`, `/comments`). It tells us *what* resource or action is being requested.
2.  **The HTTP Method:** This tells us *what kind of action* the request wants to perform on the resource (e.g., `GET` to retrieve data, `POST` to create data, `PUT` or `PATCH` to update data, `DELETE` to remove data).

A **Route** combines a specific URL path with a specific HTTP method and links them to a particular function or set of functions that will process the request.

For example, in our project, the route for registering a user is:

*   **URL Path:** `/api/v1/users/register`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Handler:** The function that contains the logic for creating a new user.

Routes act as the initial dispatcher, directing the request to the correct "department" or "handler" within our application based on its destination and purpose.

## Where Are Routes Defined?

In our project structure, routes are typically grouped together in files within the `src/routes` folder. In [Chapter 3: Express Application Instance (app)](03_express_application_instance__app__.md), we saw this line in `src/App.js`:

```javascript
// src/App.js
// ... other imports and app.use() middleware ...

import userRouter from "./routes/router.js"; // Import a router instance

// Direct all requests starting with /api/v1/users to the userRouter
app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter);

// ... export app ...
```

This line tells our main `app` instance: "Any request where the URL path begins with `/api/v1/users`, don't handle it here. Instead, pass it over to the `userRouter` object."

The `userRouter` object is itself a mini-application specifically designed to handle all the *user-related* routes. It's created using `express.Router()`.

Let's look inside `src/routes/router.js`:

```javascript
// src/routes/router.js
import { Router } from "express"; // 1. Import Router
import { upload } from "../middlewares/multer.js"; // We'll see this later
import {
  LoginUser,
  RegisterUser,
  // ... other controller functions ...
} from "../controllers/User.js"; // We'll see controllers later

const router = Router(); // 2. Create a router instance

/* --------------------------- RegisterUser route --------------------------- */
router.route("/register").post(/* ... middleware ... */, RegisterUser); // 3. Define a route

/* ------------------------------- login route ------------------------------ */
router.route("/login").post(LoginUser); // 4. Define another route

// ... more routes ...

export default router; // 5. Export the router instance
```

Here's what's happening:

1.  `import { Router } from "express";`: We import the `Router` class from Express.
2.  `const router = Router();`: This creates a new router instance. This `router` object is similar to the main `app` instance but is specifically for defining a set of related routes (in this case, user routes).
3.  `router.route("/register").post(...)`: This is how we define a specific route.
4.  `router.route("/login").post(LoginUser);`: Another route definition.
5.  `export default router;`: We export this configured router instance so it can be imported and used by the main `app` instance (as shown in the `src/App.js` snippet above).

Using `express.Router()` helps keep our routes organized! Instead of defining *all* routes directly on the main `app` instance, we can create separate routers for different parts of our API (like a `userRouter`, a `videoRouter`, a `commentRouter`, etc.) and then connect them to the `app` with a base path (`/api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/videos`, etc.).

## Defining a Specific Route: The User Registration Example

Let's focus on the user registration route from `src/routes/router.js` as described in the README:

*   **URL Path:** `/api/v1/users/register`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`

Looking at the code:

```javascript
// src/routes/router.js

// ... imports and router = Router() ...

/* --------------------------- RegisterUser route --------------------------- */
router.route("/register").post(
  // Middleware array - runs before the controller
  upload.fields([
    { name: "Avatar", maxCount: 1 },
    { name: "CoverImg", maxCount: 1 },
  ]),
  // The final handler (the controller function)
  RegisterUser
);

// ... more routes ...
```

Let's break down this line:

*   `router.route("/register")`: The `.route("/register")` part specifies the URL path segment *relative to where this router is mounted*. Since in `src/App.js` we mounted this `userRouter` at `/api/v1/users`, the full path for this route becomes `/api/v1/users` + `/register` = `/api/v1/users/register`. Using `.route()` is a convenient way to chain different HTTP methods (`.get()`, `.post()`, `.patch()`, etc.) to the *same* URL path if needed, although in this case, we only have `.post()`.
*   `.post(...)`: This method specifies that this route will only respond to `POST` requests. If someone sends a `GET` request to `/api/v1/users/register`, this specific route definition won't match it.
*   `upload.fields([...])`: This is a **middleware** function. It's placed *before* the main handler (`RegisterUser`). Middleware in a route definition run in order, processing the request *before* it reaches the final handler. The `upload.fields` middleware from `multer` is specifically used here to handle file uploads (Avatar and CoverImg), making the file data available on the request object for the `RegisterUser` function. (We'll cover file uploads and middleware more deeply in later chapters).
*   `RegisterUser`: This is the final **handler function**, often called a **controller**. This is the function that contains the main business logic for registering a user (taking the data, validating it, saving it to the database, etc.). It will only be executed *after* all the preceding middleware (like `upload.fields`) have successfully completed and passed the request along.

So, this single line of code sets up the rule: "When a `POST` request arrives at `/api/v1/users/register`, first run the `upload` middleware to handle files, and then execute the `RegisterUser` function."

Let's look at the login route:

```javascript
// src/routes/router.js

// ... imports and router = Router() ...

/* ------------------------------- login route ------------------------------ */
router.route("/login").post(LoginUser);

// ... more routes ...
```

This is simpler: a `POST` request to `/api/v1/users/login` goes directly to the `LoginUser` controller function. There's no middleware needed before the main login logic in this specific definition (though global middleware like `express.json` from [Chapter 3](03_express_application_instance__app__.md) would still run before it).

And the logout route:

```javascript
// src/routes/router.js

// ... imports and router = Router() ...

/* ------------------------------ logOut route ------------------------------ */
router.route("/logout").post(varifyJWT, logOut);

// ... more routes ...
```

This one shows another middleware: `varifyJWT`. A `POST` request to `/api/v1/users/logout` will first run the `varifyJWT` middleware (which checks if the user is authenticated using a JSON Web Token - covered in [Chapter 6](06_authentication_middleware__varifyjwt__.md)), and *only if* that middleware succeeds, the `logOut` controller function will be executed. This ensures that only logged-in users can log out.

## How a Request Navigates Routes

Let's trace the journey of a `POST` request to `/api/v1/users/register`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A[User's Browser]
    participant B[Express App (app)]
    participant C[App Middleware<br/>(e.g., CORS, JSON)]
    participant D[User Router]
    participant E[Route Middleware<br/>(upload.fields)]
    participant F[Controller<br/>(RegisterUser)]

    A->>B: Send Request (POST /api/v1/users/register)
    Note over B: App receives request
    B->>C: Pass Request to App Middleware Chain
    Note over C: Process CORS, parse body, etc.
    C-->>B: Request continues
    Note over B: App matches URL path<br/>start (/api/v1/users)
    B->>D: Route Request to User Router
    Note over D: Router matches path segment<br/>(/register) and method (POST)
    D->>E: Pass Request to Route Middleware (upload)
    Note over E: Handle file uploads (Avatar, CoverImg)<br/>Add file info to req
    E-->>D: Middleware finishes, passes request
    D->>F: Pass Request to Controller (RegisterUser)
    Note over F: Execute registration logic<br/>(save user to DB, etc.)
    F-->>D: Send Response back
    D-->>B: Pass Response back
    B-->>A: Send Response back to User
```

This diagram illustrates how the `app` instance ([Chapter 3](03_express_application_instance__app__.md)) acts as the initial dispatcher, sending user-related requests to the `userRouter`. The `userRouter` then finds the specific route definition (`/register` POST) and executes any middleware defined for that route *before* finally calling the associated controller function (`RegisterUser`).

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned about the crucial role of **Routes**:

*   Routes define the specific **URL paths** and **HTTP methods** that our server listens for.
*   They act as a map, directing incoming requests to the correct handling code.
*   In Express, we use `express.Router()` to create modular routers (`userRouter`) which are then connected to the main `app` instance at a specific base path (`/api/v1/users`).
*   A route is defined by chaining methods like `.route("/path")` and `.post()`, `.get()`, etc., followed by one or more **handler functions**.
*   These handler functions can include **middleware** (which run first to process the request, like `upload` or `varifyJWT`) and a final **controller function** (which contains the main logic for that specific request).

Understanding routes is fundamental. They are the entry points into the different functionalities of your backend API. Now that we know how requests are routed to specific controller functions, the next step is to understand what these controller functions do and how they communicate back to the user.
